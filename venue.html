      <p class="lead">The <a href="http://www.omnihotels.com/FindAHotel/AmeliaIsland.aspx">Omni Amelia Island Resort</a> will be the home to {{site.name}} once again and it is the perfect setting for an amazing time. Unlike a typical hackerspace or maker event, JSConf US is being presented in a uniqe and intimate space to encourage social interactions and give you unprecedented access to speakers and vendors. This getaway is the perfect environment to have three days, or a whole week, of complete focus on JS and community building, all while providing for your every whim. This venue, this space, this event -- it is amazing.

      <p class="lead">Nestled in Florida, just south of Georgia, the barrier island of Amelia Island is an absolute paradise, in part because it is remote location. The closest airport is <a href="http://www.jia.aero/">Jacksonville International Airport (JAX)</a>, roughly 29 miles from the resort. If you opt to rent a car OR drive to Amelia Island, there is plenty of free parking on the resort If you do bring a car, you can head to the historic and beautiful <a href="http://www.ameliaisland.com/">Fernandina Beach</a>. <br/><br/>
