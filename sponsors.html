<p>At JSConf US 2014, the best JS programmers will gather at Amelia Island, FL for a two track, three day conference that will showcase the future of JS and we want you there as a sponsor! Our sponsorships are a little bit different, there are no booths, no exhibit halls, and we encourage you to send your best technical talent. We focus the sponsorships on creating amazing shared experiences which have a far broader and longer lasting effects for you and the attendees. Whether your goal is brand exposure, recruiting, product launch, or something else, we have a sponsorship opportunity for you.</p>
