  <p>JSConf US tickets have always been one of the hottest tickets in town. Our constant dedication to quality, attention to details, and willingness to experiment have established us as leaders of the technology confernece format. This year is by no means an exception as we take our <a href="/schedule.html">revolutionary new conference format</a> to space and beyond!</p>

  <p>Your ticket provides you access to all of the social events, all of the lectures, any of the training sessions you would like to attend, and one of the <a href="/schedule.html#cyoa">choose-your-own-adventure sessions</a>. The ticket price also covers at least nine (9) hot and amazing meals prepared for you by our incredible on-site chef over the five (5) days of JSConf US. If you need any assistance/encouragement to help solidify arrangements with your employer OR you require extra assistance, please don't hesitate to <a href="mailto:team@jsconf.us">contact us directly</a>.</p>


<!--    One of the most exciting parts, like literally edge of your seat excitement, of JSConf is the process of procuring them. This is a natural problem that occurs with each successful year of running JSConf as more people both become interested in JS and aware of JSConf. We have made firm commitments of not sacrificing quality for quantity and to keep ticket prices as low as we possibly can. These two commitments run counter to how some other events are executed and to normal &quot;market economics&quot; which would dictate to increase prices and size to what the market can bear. More importantly for this discussion, these two commitments can cause a near panic rush when tickets go on sale, which is hardly fun for anyone. </p>
 -->
<!--   <p>We are often asked, &quot;Why do you insist on keeping the attendee count so low?&quot; and the answer is because we believe that a smaller, more intimate environment is necessary for the type of event and types of discussions we want to curate. JSConf is not a typical (insert-language-here)-conf in that it doesn&#39;t provide beginner/intermediate content, rather it focuses on driving the language and community further by presenting risky, but bleeding edge ideas. Unfortunately, this does not scale to the volume of attendees that other events might facilitate. This isn&#39;t an evaluation of other events, just an evaluation of our own competency and ability.</p>
 -->
<!--   <p>Another question we often get is, &quot;Why aren&#39;t tickets (cheaper||free)?&quot; and while we are constantly working to reduce the expenses of the conference, unfortunately conferences occur in the real world, which means it costs real money to create. We could reduce ticket prices to zero by taking only sponsorship funds, but that raises the expectations of what sponsors would receive in exchange and we aren&#39;t about to go down that path. The more a ticket costs, the more we, as curators, can stand on the side of the attendee and create the event for them versus for other factors. Part of the curation of JSConf is to create an environment which is prime for social interactions, this means providing an inclusive and welcoming environment (espressos, coffees, soft drinks, amazing quality food, etc) that keep attendees happy and engaged at the conference. We also value the time and effort our speakers put into making amazing presentations, so we provide for their travel and lodging while speaking at our event. This is just a decision we have made since the start and it does add to the overall cost of the event. If you want more details on why tickets cost the amount they do, please review our <a href="http://www.voodootikigod.com/hug-a-conference-organizer-the-outcome">previous posting on this matter</a>.</p>

  <h2 id='extrafood'>Extra Meal Tickets for JSConf US 2014</h2>

  <h3>Vegan Meal Ticket ($20)</h3>
  <p>We have provided vegan specific meals since 2010, every year we end up with almost 90% of those meal uneaten. These meals often cost more than the buffet meals provided to other attendees due to the special requirements to prepare them. If you require a specifically prepared meal, vegan or otherwise, that cannot be serviced as part of a group buffet, we ask that you purchase a Vegan Meal Ticket. With the meal ticket, we will have a specially prepared meal ready for you at every meal and social event. If you have any questions about this, please <a href="mailto:team@jsconf.us">email us directly</a>.</p>

  <h3>Significant Other Meal Ticket (Adult: $350, Child - 12 and under: $175)</h3>
  <p>We do invite you to bring your significant other(s) along to JSConf US 2014 and will be providing a sponsored activities track for them. In supplement to the activities some significant others have expressed interest in joining for meals with the attendees.

  <h2>Conference Attendance Agreements</h2>
  <p>By purchasing a JSConf US ticket, you will be explicitly required to agree with our stated <a href="http://jsconf.com/codeofconduct.html">Code of Conduct</a>. You acknowledge that if you or a group you are involved with act in a manner not in accordance with the code of conduct, you will be expelled from the conference with no refund. You agree that you will act with respect for other attendees, organizers, speakers, and staff (both conference and venue) for your entire stay at JSConf US. Finally, you agree that if you see something wrong you will notify a JSConf Staff member to allow them to take swift and appropriate actions.

  <h2 id='transfer'>Transferring a Ticket</h2>
  <p>Tickets will not be refunded under any circumstances, but they may be transferred.

Transfers will not be handled by or involve the JSConf team. Tickets may be transferred until May 10th, 2014 due to printing deadlines. We appreciate your understanding in this matter.</p>

  <h2>Why Are You Selling Tickets Before Speakers Are Announced And So Early?</h2>
  <p>Our conference dates are scheduled shortly after the US Federal holiday of Memorial Day, which historically has higher than normal travel costs. We are trying to allow JSConf attendees the ability to book their travel arrangements significantly in advance so as to take advantage of lower prices. We understand that the cost of a conference isn't just the price of the ticket, but also the hotel, travel, ticket, and other miscellaneous items as such we are doing our best to allow you the opportunity to make that as cost-effective as possible. We understand that some people might not be comfortable purchasing a ticket to a conference with little to no insight about what will be presented at the event. We encourage you to review our previous 5 absolutely amazing events and the wonderful track record we have. If that is not enough to convince you, please to bear in mind that we do offer all of the content for free shortly after the event. We apologize for any inconvenience or uncertainty this may cause you, but we are trying to balance the best of all worlds.</p>
